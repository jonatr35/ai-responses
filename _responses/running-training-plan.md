# 6-Month Progressive Running Training Plan

## Shin-Friendly Principles Throughout

- **Gradual volume increases** (no more than 10% per week)
- **Surface variation** when possible (treadmill for some runs to reduce impact)
- **Easy pace emphasis** (80% of running at conversational pace)
- **Strategic rest** and recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks
- **Strength work** to support running mechanics and reduce compensation patterns

## Weekly Schedule Structure

## Key Guidelines

### Pacing

- **Easy runs:** Conversational pace, you should be able to speak in full sentences (roughly 60-90 sec/mile slower than marathon pace for you)
- **Steady pace:** Comfortably hard, could speak in short phrases
- **Pickups:** Controlled faster running, not all-out sprints

### Treadmill Usage

Consider doing 1-2 runs per week on the treadmill (especially during the build phase) - the softer, more consistent surface can be shin-friendly. Good candidates: one midweek easy run or your Friday quality session.

### Listen to Your Body

- If the shin sensation worsens or becomes painful, **back off immediately** and consider getting it evaluated
- Skip a run and walk instead if you're feeling beat up
- Better to add an extra rest day than push through concerning pain

### Recovery Weeks

Built in every 3-4 weeks - don't skip these! They allow your body to adapt and reduce injury risk.

### Cross-Training Options

*For Wednesday when cross-training is listed:*

- Cycling (30-40 min easy)
- Swimming
- Elliptical
- Rowing
- Easy 30-40 min walk

### Progression Notes

- If any week feels too hard, repeat it before progressing
- The long run should never be more than 30-35% of your weekly mileage
- By Week 24, you'll be ready to maintain 25-30 mpw or start training for your next race!
