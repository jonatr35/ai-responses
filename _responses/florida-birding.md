## Savannas Preserve State Park

### Half-Day Visit (3-4 hours)

**Start at Canoe Launch** (0.7 miles in from main gate)

- Scan marsh from boardwalk
- Walk Yellow Trail (1 mile) or Blue Trail (2 miles)
- Return to parking area

**Drive to Hawk's Bluff** (separate entrance)

- Walk 1-mile loop
- Scan Lake Eden

## Jonathan Dickinson State Park

**Location:** Hobe Sound, ~30 min south

This 11,500-acre park offers diverse habitats and over 150 species.

### Key Species (January)

- Florida Scrub-Jay (endemic to Florida—ask rangers for locations)
- Red-headed Woodpecker & Hairy Woodpecker (both breed here)
- Bald Eagle
- Wild Turkey
- Northern Waterthrush (wintering along the Loxahatchee River)
- Pine Warbler
- Least Bittern
- Barred Owl

**Tip:** Head to the scrub habitat trails (Hobe Mountain area) first thing in the morning for Scrub-Jays. The 3-4 hour timeframe works perfectly here.

### Notable Trails

**Kitching Creek Trail System** - Great birding trail

## Fort Pierce Inlet State Park & Jack Island Preserve

**Duration:** ~20 minutes

This coastal location offers shorebirds and gulls you haven't seen yet.

### Key Species

- Black Skimmer (loafs on Dynamite Point sandbars)
- Dunlin
- Sandwich Tern
- Bonaparte's Gull, Herring Gull, Great Black-backed Gull (winter)
- Common Loon & Red-breasted Merganser (winter, in the surf)
- Yellow-crowned Night-Heron

**Tip:** Hike the Oak Hammock Trail for warblers, then scan the beach and inlet jetties.

## Green Cay Wetlands & Wakodahatchee Wetlands

**Location:** Boynton Beach/Delray Beach, ~1 hour south

These created wetlands are phenomenal for close-up bird photography and reliable sightings. Just 2 miles apart, do both!

### Key Species

- American Bittern (exceptionally reliable here in winter—often visible from the boardwalk)
- Least Bittern
- Black-bellied Whistling-Duck
- Black-crowned Night-Heron & Yellow-crowned Night-Heron

- Wilson's Snipe

**Tip:** Walk Wakodahatchee (0.75 mi) first for the most bird activity, then drive to Green Cay (1.5 mi boardwalk). Both are free. Birds are extremely close and acclimated to people.

## Spruce Bluff Preserve

**Rating:** 4.6 | **Activity:** Hiking

Smaller preserve but good variety with hardwood edges and water. Locals report woodpeckers, raptors, herons, and resident woodland birds.

### Why Go

- Underrated spot with mixed woodland and scrub habitat
- January can bring a diversity of songbirds you haven't yet marked off
- Quiet trails perfect for a focused 2–3 hour walk
