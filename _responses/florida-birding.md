<details>
<summary>Morning Birding Itinerary: Viera Wetlands</summary>

### At a Glance

- **Hours:** Sunrise – Sunset

- **Distance from Port St. Lucie:** ~1.5 hours north

### Layout

200 acres divided into four "cells" (marshy impoundments) plus a central lake, connected by dike roads. Birding is primarily done by car or on foot along the dikes.

### Recommended Route: Clockwise Loop

#### Stop 1: Entrance Road & First Cell (7:00-7:45 AM)

- Scan the first impoundment immediately after entering
- Check fence posts and palm snags for Crested Caracara (resident family—often perched prominently at dawn)
- **Target species:** Bald Eagle (active nest visible from dike), Northern Harrier, Savannah Sparrow in grassy edges

#### Stop 2: Inner Cells Loop (7:45-9:00 AM)

- Drive slowly or walk the dike roads around all four cells
- Stop frequently to scan open water and muddy edges
- **Target species:** Hooded Merganser, Northern Shoveler, Lesser Scaup, American White Pelican, Wilson's Snipe, King Rail (listen for grunting in reeds)

#### Stop 3: Central Lake & Observation Tower (9:00-9:30 AM)

- Climb the observation tower for panoramic views
- Scan for raptors riding morning thermals
- Check reedy edges for Sora and bitterns

#### Bonus: Click Ponds (9:30-10:00 AM)

- Located ~300 yards north on Wickham Road (Duda Cocoa Ranch sod farm at 10002 N Wickham Rd)

- Also good for additional shorebirds and wading birds

### Key Species To Target (New for Your List)

| Species | Where to Look | Difficulty |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Crested Caracara | Fence posts, palm tops, soaring | Easy-Moderate |
| Northern Harrier | Low over marsh, both sexes present | Easy |
| American White Pelican | Open water, especially Click Ponds | Easy |
| Hooded Merganser | Open water in cells | Easy |
| Northern Shoveler | Dabbling in shallows | Easy |
| Lesser Scaup | Rafts on deeper water | Easy |
| Wilson's Snipe | Muddy edges, wet grass | Moderate |
| King Rail | Reedy edges—listen for calls | Hard |
| Least Bittern | Dense reeds—patient scanning | Hard |

### Quick Tips

- **Caracara strategy:** Most reliable at dawn—scan every tall perch, dead palm, and fence post as you enter
- **Drive vs. walk:** Driving allows quick coverage; walking gets you closer to skulky marsh birds
- **Smell warning:** Adjacent water treatment plant—some days are worse than others; west wind helps
- **Crowds:** Popular with birders, joggers, and cyclists—weekday mornings are quieter
- **Alligators:** Abundant—keep pets leashed and maintain distance

### Sample Timeline

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 7:00 AM | Arrive, scan for Caracara at entrance |
| 7:00-7:45 AM | First cell—eagles, harriers, caracara |
